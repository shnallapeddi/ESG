### What is ESG?

Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) is an evaluation framework that measures a firm’s collective conscientiousness toward environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and ethical governance.
ESG typically translates into a composite score derived from diverse data sources and metrics, that reflects how responsibly an organization manages its environmental footprint, treats its people, and governs itself.
These metrics often involve intangible assets such as corporate ethics, transparency, diversity, and sustainability impact, which together influence investor confidence and long-term valuation.

### Case in Point - Apple Inc.

Apple serves as a striking example of how ESG dynamics unfold in the real world.
Despite being rated as an ESG Leader in “Controversial Sourcing” by MSCI, Apple was named in a 2019 U.S. lawsuit (alongside Google) over child labor-related cobalt mining deaths in Congo, as reported by The Guardian.

Here’s the nuance:
1. Apple procures cobalt for its batteries through Umicore, which sources it from Glencore, a company facing severe controversies surrounding human rights and labor practices. Glencore, in turn, is rated as an ESG Laggard in Labor Management.
2. This case highlights a paradox within ESG scoring, even companies with strong sustainability reputations can be indirectly exposed to ethical risks through their supply chain dependencies.
3. The takeaway: ESG isn’t just about a company’s direct behavior, but the entire ecosystem it is connected to.

### The Fund Manager’s Perspective

Among the various stakeholders in the ESG ecosystem : nvestors, policymakers, NGOs - the Fund Manager(let's name her Sally), plays a pivotal role.
Her responsibility is to ensure that her bank’s investment portfolio remains risk-averse, compliant, and insulated from external ESG threats.

1. Needs: She must verify that no external entity in the portfolio’s network introduces ESG related risks.
2. Wants: A mechanism that continuously identifies any potential external factors that could compromise ESG compliance.
3. Pains: Unknown or hidden ESG risks raise exposure for the bank, impacting its reputation, compliance, and investor trust.
4. For Sally, visibility into both direct and indirect ESG exposures isn’t optional; it’s foundational to responsible fund management.

### Business Overview

ESG Network Analytics offers a holistic, data-driven view of ESG metrics for every company in a portfolio, consolidating insights from multiple data sources - You can find a demo of the solution in the attached files.

1. Problem
Banks and fund managers often invest in companies that may hold hidden business ties or sub-investments in non–ESG-compliant entities.
Such connections are rarely transparent in traditional S&P index or ESG reports, leaving financial institutions exposed to unseen ethical and compliance risks.
2. Solution
The proposed solution uses Graph Network Analysis to reveal these invisible linkages.
By leveraging algorithms such as Louvain clustering and Connected Component Analysis, the system:
  1. Maps all companies in a portfolio and their extended connections.
  2. Detects direct and indirect relationships that could impact ESG performance.
  3. Flags communities or clusters where low ESG scores or controversies may pose systemic risk.
